On 30 December 2021, the so-called Darcos Law was passed in France. Effective from October 2023, it will impose a minimum delivery charge of €3 for all book orders under €35, regardless of the delivery method. The stated aim is to support the purchase of books in physical outlets, whereas in recent years many consumers have increasingly turned to the major e-commerce platforms. We use data from this event to assess whether measures impacting shipping costs of books are efficient regarding platform regulation.
