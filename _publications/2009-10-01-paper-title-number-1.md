With Marc Bourreau and Lukasz Grzybowski. 
This paper aims to study the effect of network infrastructure such as broadband internet
over voters behavior at a local level. Using data on municipal elections between 2008 and
2020 as well as fiber network deployment data in France, we estimate the probability of an
incumbent mayor to be reelected or not to be reelected. The outcomes of the Heckman
models with instrumental variables yield that the effect of fiber deployment is heterogeneous
among french municipalities, depending on their size, their geographic situation or even
their political commitment. Overall, it appears that incumbent mayors are punished by
their electors when fiber is not developed while there is a national plan.
